## Development Guidelines

### Testing Changes

Before submitting a PR, test your changes:

```bash
# Lint the chart
helm lint chart/

# Template the chart to check for errors
helm template webstation chart/

# Install in a test cluster
helm install webstation-test chart/ --dry-run --debug
```

### Chart Versioning

- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Do **not** manually bump `version` in `Chart.yaml` in your PR — releases are driven by git tags.
  To cut a release: merge to `main`, then create and push a tag matching `vX.Y.Z` from the tip of
  `main` (e.g. `git tag v0.2.0 && git push origin v0.2.0`). The `Release Chart` workflow reads the
  tag, sets `chart/Chart.yaml`'s `version` to match, packages/publishes the chart, and commits the
  version bump back to `main`.
- Update `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml` in your PR when pinning the chart to a specific webstation image
  tag (this is independent from the chart's own `version`/tag).

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation in YAML files
- Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
- Add comments for complex configurations
- Follow Helm best practices

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant
